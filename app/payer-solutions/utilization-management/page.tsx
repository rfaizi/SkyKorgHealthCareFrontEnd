                What is Utilization Management?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Utilization management is a proactive healthcare process that
                evaluates whether medical services and treatments are
                appropriate, necessary, and aligned with payer policies.
                These reviews ensure that patients receive the right care
                while preventing unnecessary medical procedures and costs.
              </p>

              <p className="mt-4">
                From prior authorization to concurrent and retrospective
                reviews, utilization management plays a key role in
                improving patient outcomes while maintaining financial
                accountability across healthcare systems.
